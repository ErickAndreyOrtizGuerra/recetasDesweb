# Assets Directory

This directory contains the app assets like icons and splash screens.

For a complete Expo setup, you would need:
- icon.png (1024x1024)
- splash.png 
- adaptive-icon.png (for Android)
- favicon.png (for web)

You can generate these assets using the Expo CLI or create them manually.
